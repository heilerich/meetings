# Join Microsoft Teams & Skype Meetings

akai is a Mac app, that resides in the menu bar. Given access to the calendar, it shows todays events from the `Exchange` calendar in a dropdown menu with the option, to join an attached Microsoft Teams meeting or Skype meeting by simply clicking on it's name.

## Motivation

When working as a consultant, attending meetings is part of my daily job. I needed a simple app to quickly check, which meetings I have to join today. Further, a possibility to directly jump into the meetings, without having to open Microsoft Teams or Skype would save me a lot of time -- akai was born.

## Installation

Download the app from the [release page](https://github.com/nicolai92/mac-akai/releases/tag/v1.1), unzip the file and copy it to the program's folder. You may find the app by it's name *Meetings* then.

## Usage

When first launching the app, you may be asked to grant access to the calendar. This is necessary, to read today's events from the `Exchange` calendar. After that, the app resides in the menu bar and reveals the events by clicking on it's icon (which is a clock logo).

If the event has a Microsoft Teams or Skype meeting attached, the name of the event is clickable and let's the user directly join the meeting. If there's no meeting attached, then the name of the meeting location is shown.
